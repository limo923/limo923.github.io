CFCS, Computer Science Department, Peking University, Beijing, China.

I am a fifth-year PhD student at Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). I am expected to obtain my doctoral degree in July next year. I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree from the Department of Computer Science at Peking University.

My research focuses on addressing endogenous security problems in blockchain protocols by analyzing economic vulnerabilities and designing incentive-compatible, cryptographically secure, and operationally efficient solutions. To achieve this, I have developed computational techniques and tools for targeted scenario analysis, modeling, and protocol design, including: 1) A dynamic protocol analysis framework integrating algorithmic game theory, Markov decision processes, and reinforcement learning. 2) A protocol implementation methodology combining mechanism design, algorithmic optimization, and cryptographic primitives.

In my work, I reconstruct protocol execution scenarios to model miners’ and participants’ utility functions and strategic spaces, analyze behavioral interactions, and design new mechanisms that satisfy target conditions. By bridging theory and practice, I validate conclusions through simulations and code implementations. My research outcomes have been adopted by Cryptape’s Nervos blockchain and China’s ChainMaker to enhance ecosystem security and consensus protocols.

During my Ph.D. studies, I was a visiting researcher in Prof. [Bin Xiao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csbxiao/)'s group at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University from January 2023 to May 2023.
